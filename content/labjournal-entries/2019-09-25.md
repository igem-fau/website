***Notes***



CFP part: 



Checking plates in the incubator

Plenty colonies in Tuner but not BL21 and STAR (Those were the "new" competent cells)

=BL21 and STAR not properly competent!!



New heatshock with old stock of competent bacs (STAR and BL21) acording to Evas protocol



HEK: 



Check the flasks in the incubator: Live and happy ~ 50% confluent

Seeding of 4 x 10^6 cells in a cell culture plate (10 ml) like following. 

1. Discard medium

2. Washing with 3 ml trypsin

3. Incubation with 3 ml trypsin

4. When cells are detached mixing with 7 ml Medium 

5. Counting in neubauer chamber (total cell number 10,2 x 10^6 cells) 

6. 8 ml cell mix in the plate + 2 ml medium

Rest of the cells back in the flask, ad 20 ml with medium



E. coli: 

Digest of pACYC184: 5µL cutsmart, 11µL DNA, 1µL Cla-I, 1µL Sal-I 

Water was not added! (WRONG);

Incubation @37 °C for 1h and following inactivation @65 °C for 20 min;

Proceeded nonetheless and added water aftewards to have a convenient volume of 50 µl





Digest of the constructs (K1 - K4b) which were already digested on the 07.09.19. ClaI is not a time saver qualified enzyme and thus the digestion time of 15 minutes might have not been sufficient.
1 h digest with Cla-I and Sal-I (each 0,5µL) in a volume of 20 µl @37 °C;

Inactivation @65 °C for 20 min;



With the sample concentration determined on 7.9 the new sample concentration was calculated, as the digest altered the volume;



Sample Concentration:

| **K1**  | **K2a** | **K2b** | **K3a** | **K3b** | **K4a** | **K4b** |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 67.5 ng | 110 ng  | 58,4 ng | 71,8 ng | 63,8 ng | 56,6 ng | 62,9 ng |



Only 6 Chloramphenicol plates were left in the fridge, so ligation was only performed with K1, K2a and K2b;

Amounts necessary for the ligation were calculated for all constructs;



| **Construct** | **1:10 ng** | **1:10 µl** | **1:15 ng** | **1:15 µl** |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **K1**        | 207,4       | 3           | 311,1       | 4,5         |
| **K2a**       | 151,4   | 1,4         | 227,1       | 2,1         |
| **K2b**       | 144,2       | 2,46        | 216,3       | 3,7         |
| **K3a**       | 105,6       | 1,8         | 158,4       | 2,7         |
| **K3b**       | 100         | 1,9         | 150         | 2,85        |
| **K4a**       | 105,6       | 2,3         | 158,4       | 3,45        |
| **K4b**       | 100,6       | 1,6         | 150,9       | 2,4         |

Incubation @RT for 20 min;

Inactivation @65 °C for 20 min;    



Perform Heatshock after Evas Protocol;

Heatshock samples were not plated on plates, as the remaining Chloramphenicol**+** were found to be contaminated;
Samples were therefor stored @4 °C;



**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

- Produce new Chloramph Plates

- Test Transfection of HEK293T cells with K1
