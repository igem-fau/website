**Notes**

Repeat the IPTG

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**



Check if cells are growing 

Getting new cells and culture them properly 



**CFP part:** 



Cheking plates in the incubator

Plenty colonies in Tuner but not BL21 and STAR (Those were the "new" competent cells)

=BL21 and STAR not properly competent!!



New heatshock with old stock of competent bacs (STAR and BL21) acording to Evas protocol



HEK: 



Check the flasks in the incubator: Live and happy ~ 50% confluent

Seewing of 4 x 10^6 cells in a plate (10 mL) like following. 

1. Discard medium

2. Washing with 3 mL Trypsin

3. Incubation with 3 mL trypsin

4. When cells were detached mixing with 7 mL Medium 

5. Counting in neubauer chamber (total cell number 10,2 x 10^6 cells) 

6. 8 mL cell mix in the plate + 2 mL medium

Rest of the cells back in the flask, ad 20 mL with medium



E. coli: 

Digest of pACYC184: 5µL cutsmart, 11µL DNA, 1µL Cla-I, 1µL Sal-I 

Water was not added! (WRONG)



Digest of the constructs which were already digested on the 07.09. but not for 1 h just 15 min. 

1 h digest with Cla-I and Sal-I (each 0,5µL)



Ligation
