## Protocol   
  
Substance | concentration |   | |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
Cut Smart buffer| 2 µL | 2 µg (= 1 µl) | 1 µg (= µl)  
DNA | 7,98 µL|
Enzyme | 1,5 µL|
Water | 44,52 µL |   

  
Incoulation of 200 µL sample 2 from the 27.05.2019

**Miniprep**

-   Adding 10 mL Equilibration buffer at the collum
-   Centrifugation of overnightculture for 10 min at 4000 x g and removement of all the medium
-   Resuspension of the pellet in 4 mL resuspension buffer (R3)
-   Adding of 4 mL Lysis buffer and mixing by capping the tube for 5 times
-   Incubation for 5 min at RT
-   Adding 4 mL precipitation buffer (N3) and inverting till it is homogenous
-   Centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 x g at RT
-   Loadng supernatant on the collum, drain by gravity
-   Adding of 10 mL washing buffer to the collum twice
-   Placing collum on a 15 mL tube and adding of 5 mL elution buffer (E4) and letting it drain by gravity
-   Adding 3,5 mL isopropanol and mixing it well
-   Centrifugation for 30 min at 5000 x g at RT
-   Discarding of the supernatant
-   Adding 3 mL 70% ethanol
-   Centrifugation for 5 min, 5000 x g at RT
-   Remove supernatant
-   Airdry pellet for 10 min
-   Resuspension of pellet in 200 µL
-   Storage at -20°C (still in virology lab)

**Gel**

Mixing of 60 µL digest with 12 µL loading buffer

Loading a agarose gel

130 V for 1 h

  

**Gel extraction**

Cutting the digest out of the gel.

1. Adding 200 µL /per 100 mg gel piece of NTI.

2. 5 min 50°C

3. Placing of the collum in a collection tube and loading of the sample.

4. Centrifugation at 11000 rpm for 30 s.

5. Adding twice 700 µL NT3 and centrifugation each time at 11000 rpm for 30 s.

6. Drying of the silica membrane for 1 min at 11000 rpm.

7. Placing collumn on a 1,5 mL sterile Eppi.

8. Adding 20 µL NE buffer and centrifugation for 1 min at 11000 rpm.

9. Storage at -20°C.

  

**Nanodrop**

Different results with a wide range
