## Protocol  
**Notes**

-   Stored LB-medium in fridge
-   Used 3 E.coli strains: Tuner, BL21 Star, BL21
-   Pipetting under bunsen burner in Winkler lab
-   For each strain: 10 mL LB-medium combined with 1 sterile pipet tip E.coli in 12 ml not fully closed reaction tubes
-   Cultivation in top incubation shaker (left side, 3 12 mL reaction tubes) in room 02.053 at 37°C with 130 rpm
-   Autoclave 100 mL flasks for tomorrow 26.06.19
-   **If we are using stuff from the Winkler lab, bring it back**
-   **If we are using workspace in the Winkler lab - clean the bench with 70% Ethanol**

  

  

**Protocol:**

1.  Unfreeze E.coli
2.  Centrifuge tube with Mini-Centrifuge --Solution at the bottom of the reaction tube

**Next Steps are performed next to the bunsen burner**

3. Fill 10 ml LB-medium into 12 ml reaction tube under

4. Dip 1 sterile pipet tip into E.coli reaction tube

5. Throw pipet tip into 12 ml reaction tube and close it

  

6. Cultivation in incubation shaker for 20 hours at 37°C with 130 rpm

-   Store remaining E.coli at -80°C

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

-   Incubation flasks are needed for further cultivation. Autoclave 100 mL flasks for tomorrow 26.06.19
-   Need lab briefing from some of winklers lab

  

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   OD measurement --further cultivation
-   Cultivation in 100mL flasks with the incubation shaker in our lab
-   Freeze 1mL from each E.coli strain at -80°C
-   Wait for autoclaved flasks. Use them to cultivate our bacteria in our shaker
