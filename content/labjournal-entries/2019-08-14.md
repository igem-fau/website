**PCR Amplification and overhang:**

* used every construct besides K1 from clean up

**pUC19 digest:**

* digest for 1 h with Sma1 at 25 °C in CutSmart Buffer
* 5 µL pUC19 (Bl21 K3 from gel 07-23)
* 2 µL restriction enzyme
* pUC19 gel extraction: 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis with undigested pUC19 as control
* no pUC19 was digested! BL21 K3 is empty!

**Miniprep from the ON cultures 2019-08-13:**

* extract-me miniprep kit used
* nanodrop measurements are on the respective tubes
* control digestion with Pst1
  * used 500 ng of each miniprep
  * used 1 µL Pst1-HF and 5 µL CutSmart Buffer
  * stopped reaction with 10 µL 6x loading dye and used 20 µL for gel electrophoresis
