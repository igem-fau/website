## Protocol  
  
**Notes**

-   Stored LB-medium in fridge
-   Used 3 E.coli strains: Tuner, BL21 Star, BL21
-   Pipetting under bunsen burner in Winkler lab
-   For each strain: 155 mL LB-medium combined the 10 ml of the previous bacteria culture (25.06.19)
-   Cultivation in top incubation shaker in room 02.053 at 37°C with 130 rpm
-   stuff flask holder with paper towels to keep the flasks in place
-   autoclaved flasks from the previous day not yet usable

  

  

**Protocol:**

(Performed next to a bunsen burner)

1.  Fill flask with desired volume of LB medium
2.  sterilize tip of the pipet, the lid of the bottle with medium and the edge of the flask in the flame to prevent contamination
3.  add content of the previous culture tubes to the new flasks
4.  Cultivation in incubation shaker for 20 hours at 37°C with 130 rpm

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

-   briefing for the lab desperately needed!
-   Which kuvettes for OD measurement?
-   flasks from the previous day not yet usable

  

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   measure OD
-   make cells competent
-   freeze a batch  
  
  -   3x 25 ml pipette
-   gloves, paper towels, 70% ethanol
-   490 ml LB medium
