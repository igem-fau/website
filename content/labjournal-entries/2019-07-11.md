aimtask: repeat failed PCR with correct amount of primer at 57 °C with and without DMSO
protocol: NEB PCR kit
date: 2019-07-11
participants: Daniel Schreyer, Lena Schorr, Lisa Vogg

* set up two PCR reactions:

DNA			|5 µL		
------------------------|------------|---|---
Primer fw (10 µM)	|1.25 µL
Primer re (10 µM)	|1.25 µL
Master Mix		|12.5 µL
dH2O or DMSO (15 %)	|5 µL
		|25 µL

* run PCR at 57 °C
  * last PCR might have failed due to too low temperatures
  * last PCRs for overhang generation might have failed due to much too high primer concentrations, would explain very bright bands in the previous gel
* amplified constructs form the very first PCR were not sufficient fpr the reaction
* set up another PCR to amplify the constructs K1, K2a and K3a in a 25 µL reaction at 60 °C
* run 0.8 % agarose gel (small) for the amplified constructs
  * 2 µL DNA, 18 µL total volume in each pocket
  * run at 130 V
  * 3 µL 1 kb DNA ladder
* run 0.8 % gel (medium) for the overhang PCR
  * used 2 µL DNA and 6 µL of test vector from the day before
* autoclaved 1 L LB medium
