**Notes**



**Control Gel electrophoresis:**



A 1% Agarose Gel was prepared and the samples from the digested Mini Prep (6.7.) and the E. coli Restriction PCR (6.7.) were applied;



Gel 1:

| Ladder | C1   | C2   | C3   | C4   | C5   | C6   | C7   | C8   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |



Gel 2:

| Ladder | K1   | K2a  | K2b  | K3a  | H20  | H20  | K4a  | K4b  | K3b  |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |



Of the PCR 3 µl were used to create a 20 µl sample with loading dye and water;

Of the digested Mini Prep 25 µl were used together with 4,2 µl;

To the gel 15 µl of each sample were applied;

**PCR Purification of K2b, K3a, K3b, K4a, K4b:**



Performed PCR Purification according to the QiaQuick Purification Protocol and eluted the samples in 30 µl EB-Buffer;

**Gel extraction K1, K2a:**



For the Gel extraction another Gel of K1 and K2a with a higher sample concentration was prepared;

For K1 the band at approx 1,7 kb was extracted; 

Construct 2a with the Sites for Restriction cloning is approx. 1400 bp long, to be safe though also the bad that was seen at the height of roughly 1200 bp was extracted and purified;

The samples were eluted in 50 µl EB Buffer;

**Cast new Amp+ Plates:**



New AMP Plates were necessary so 35g of LB-Agar Powder were mixed with 1l of MilliQ Water and mixed thoroughly.
Mixture was autoclaved and after sufficient cooling Amp (50 mg/ml) was added to reach a concentration of 50 µg/ml;

With the Broth new Plates were casted;

**Heatshock of CFP c2 into Star/Bl21/Tuner:**



Heatshock with CFP+Puc19 clone 2 into Bl21, Star and Tuner with 2 µl DNA;

Eva Heatshock Protocol was used plus an extra Step with 200 µl SOC Medium after the 2 min incubation on ice;

Plated 200 µl of each sample onto Amp+ plates and stored the remaining 200 µl @ 4 °C;

Incubate @37 °C for 15 min;

Inactivate @ 65 °C for 20 min;



To avoid uncut vector, that might reduce the efficacy of a following ligation Gel Extraction of the 3,6 kb long fragment was performed;

The sample was eluted in 30 µl Buffer EB;

**Ligation of digested and gel extracted pACYC184 with the digested the digested E. coli constructs (K1-K4b) in a 1:7 ratio (vector:insert):**



Before the Ligation the amount DNA amount was measured in the Nanodrop:

Short Spin the Samples and incubate @RT for 10 min;





With the samples **Heat shock** was performed after Evas Protocol + SOC Step; 

The 200µl of the ransformed cells were seeded on Amp+ plates and placed into the incubator @ 37 °C overnight;

**Calculations and Results**



**Control Gel electrophoresis:**



The control gel electrophoresis showed that the digestion in most of the samples were successfull. In some (4,6,7,8) uncut DNA was visible;

Sample 5 and 8 do also not show the expected band at approx 0,7 kb;



All PCR samples showed bands at their expected heights; 

Just K1 and K2a had a strong unspecific bands. This is why the correct band was extracted out of the Gel instead of PCR Purification like with the other samples;



 

***Problems faced / possible error causes***

Forgot to inactivate the Ligase @ 65 °C for 10 min;
