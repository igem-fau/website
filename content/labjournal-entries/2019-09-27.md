**Measurement part:**

 

Take ON cultures out of shaker 

Measure the smaples with spectrometer



Bl21 puc19 neg: 1,098

STAR puC19 neg: 1,17

TUNER pUC19: CFP neg: 1,41



Prepared samples and induced them with IPTG



|                | Culture [mL] | LB Amp [mL] | IPTG 1mM with LB amp [mL] |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| BL21 pos       | 5            | 0           | 5                         |
| STAR pos       | 5            | 0           | 5                         |
| TUNER pos      | 5            | 0           | 5                         |
| BL21 negative  | 2,5          | 2,5         | 5                         |
| STAR negative  | 2,5          | 2,5         | 5                         |
| TUNER negative | 2            | 3           | 5                         |



Incubation for 3 hours at 37°C



Sonification: 

Measuring cell desnity at spectrometer

acording to this 10^7 cells/ mL were added for a 10 mL endvolume solution 

centrifugation for 10 min 4000 g 



Resuspend in 10 mL sonification buffer

3 10s pulses at 30W

Remove cell debris at 10.000g for 10 min



Measuring in ELISA reader: 



Not possible ELISA has just OD detection no flourescence





**E. Coli constructs:** 



Plates from heatshock out of the incubator

they were all overgrown



K1 293T: 

Medium chance 

1:5 splitting of the 293T cell flask
