## Protocol  
  
_**Notes**_

  

1. Removal of of the storage buffer by centrifugation with 100 g for 1 min

2. Adding 600 µL binding buffer and centrifugation with 100 g for 1 min

3. Adding the whole sample in multiple steps to the colume with each time centrifugation for 30s at 100g (Keeping the flow through)

4. Washing once with 600 µL of binding buffer

5. First Elution step: Adding 200µL Elution buffer to the colum

6. Second Elution step: Adding 200 µL Elution buffer to the colum

  

Running 15% SDS Gel at 300V for 30 min

10 µL of the samples were applied and 7 µL of the ladder

  

Pipetting scheme:

Ladder | Wash K1 | Wash K2a | Wash K2b | Elution1 K1 | Elution 1 K2a | Elution 1 K2b | Elution 2 K1 | Elution 2 K2a | Elution 2 K2b

  

Stain the finished Gel with Coomasie and unstain it sufficiently to see clear bands;

  

Measure the samples in the Nanodrop A280:

Determine the Extinction Coefficient for each of the constructs with ProtParam (OnlineTool);



|||1|2|3|Mean|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Elution 1|K1|25,54|25,08|27,04|25,9|
||K2a|75,6|72,57|72,02|73,22|
||K2b|47,28|48,16|48,99|48,14|
|Elution 2|K1|13,0|12,02|12,41|12,47|
||K2a|11,74|11,58|12,53|11,95|
||K2b|25,09|24,75|24,78|24,87|

For a 1:1 ratio of K2a and b following volumes were added together:

  

E1: K2b 100µL with K2a 65,9µL

E2: K2a 100µL with K2b 48µL

  

Samples were sended to Kiel for killing assay.

10µL of each sample was kept for a westernblot to verify that the tag and catcherreaction happend.
