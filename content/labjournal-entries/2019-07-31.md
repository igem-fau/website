## Protocol 


**Notes**

-   first we  down-centrifuged the over-night culture from K3ab
-   We then put 500µl of K3ab together with 500µl of Glycerol in the freezer at -80°C (box at the bottom of rang 12)
-   Then the Mini-Prep with the Extract gel was performed
-   The DNA was then stored at 4°C

**Calculations and Results**

  

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

We used 14ml overnight-culture, which was a little bit too much, because after the lysis there was a lot protein waste so we had to repeat this step several times

  

  

**Materials used**

-   Glycerol
-   Extract Me Kit

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Measure DNA concentrations
-   Performing a gel-electrophoresis with the isolated DNA (first cleave the DNA with restriction-enzymes)
-   Sent a part of the isolated DNA to sequencing-company
