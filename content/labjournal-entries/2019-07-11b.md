aimtask: Electroporation Control
protocol: NEB electroporation protocol
date: 2019-07-11
participants: Felix Pfister
---
* electroporation of pUC19 into BL21, BL21 Star
* one H2O control in BL21 Star
* generated own electroporation protocol in the GeneUser (>Users>igem>igem1)
* used 25 µL bacteria with 1 µL 1:5 diluted pUC19
  * should be 50 µL next time instead of 25 µL

**Protocol:**
1. incubate labelled agar plates in the incubator at 37 °C
2. incubate medium at 37 °C
3. thaw bacteria from -80 °C on ice
4. when bacteria are thawed, add DNA
5. keep 1 mm cuvettes on ice 
6. electroporation of the bacteria with 1 µL DNA --immediately add warm medium to cuvette and mix by pipetting up and down
7. put bacteria on shaker at 37 °C for 30-60 mi at 300 rpm
8. plate them on the 37 °C warm agar plates
9. incubate the bacteria on plates ON --not too long or they will grow too much
