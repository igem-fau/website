## Protocol  
**Notes**

-   Digestion of pSEC with EcoR5 and NHE1



|Name|Attempt 1 [µl]|Attempt 2 [µl]|Attempt 3 [µl]|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|DNA|1 µg (=0,5µl)|2 µg (=1µl)|1 µg (=0,5µl)|
|NEB buffer 3.1 (x10)|5|5|-|
|Cut-Smart (10x)|-|-|3|
|EcoR5|1µl|1µl|1µl|
|NHE1|1µl|1µl|1µl|
|H2O|42,5µl|42µl|42µl|

-   attempt 1 and 2:
    -   15 minutes on 37°C and stop reaction by adding 10 µl 6 x loading dye
-   attempt 3:
    -   60 minutes on 37°C and inactivation at 80°C

  

Preparation of a 0,8% agarose gel

-   scheme see below
-   25 µl of the samples and 5µl ladder were used
-   gel run for 45 minutes at 120 V

Extraction of line 7 (digested pSEC vector with EcoRV and NheI)

-   Extraction kit was used
-   sample stored at -20°C
