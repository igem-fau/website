protocol: Heat Shock Protocol, NEB Ligation Protocol (M0202), Q5 Hifi PCR Protocol
date: 2019-09-03  
participants: Eva Neugebauer, Felix Pfister

**Notes**



Ligation of Measurement Part with cut pUC19 from earlier of the day;

Relative amounts of vector 1 : Insert 4;

10 ng of Vector and approx. 10 ng of Insert as the Insert is only 700 bp long;

Ligation with T4 DNA Ligase Protocol (M020) from NEB;

Reaction set up on ice;



| Name | Amount [µl] | 
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| T4 DNA Ligase Buffer x10 | 3               |
| Vector DNA               | 20              |
| Insert DNA               | 0,5             |
| Water                    | 5,5,            |
| T4 Ligase                | 1               |
| **Total amount**         | **30 µl**       |



Incubate @RT for 10 min;

Heat inactivate @65 for 10 min;



With the sample **Heat shock** was performed after Evas Protocol; 

The transformed cells were seeded on an Amp+ plate and placed into the incubator @ 37 °C;



For the case of a failed ligation a PCR with the measurement part was set up;



Name                       | Amount [µl] |
---------------------------- | ----------------- |
DNA                             | 0,5             |
Q5 Hifi Polymerase MasterMix x2 | 12,5            |
Measurement Primer fw | 1,25  |
Measurement Primer re | 1,25 |
Nuclease free water             | 9,5             |
**Total amount**                | **30 µl**       |

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

 Q5 Hifi Polymerase is stored in the topmost drawer in the -20 °C fridge in the winkler lab and no longer in the Plastik Box in drawer 2;



**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**



- Check Plate in the Incubator and pick colonies if transformation was successful;

- IF not new digestion with the ordered pUC19 (XbaI/EcoRI)
