aimtask: Overnight Cultivation of E.coli strains  
protocol: E.coli Cultivation  
date: 2019-06-28

## Protocol  
  
**Notes**

-   Measure OD(600nm) (1:10 dilution) after 2 days incubation in incubation shaker of the E.coli strains BL21, BL21 Star, BL21 Tuner
-   OD of 0.71 =7.1

  

**Protocol:**

**Inoculate overnight culture:**

1.  inoculate 100 ml LB-medium with 100µl of the E.coli cultures
2.  Fill water shaker with water
3.  Place into water shaker at 37°C and 120 RPM
4.  Incubate overnight: Start 5pm --19h incubation time

  

**Materials used**

-   OD cuvette
-   25 ml plastic tip
-   3 yellow tips

  

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

-   **NEB Kit was stored at -20°C: competent E.colis should be stored at -80°C, other lab material should be stored at 4°C (DNA Ladder, buffer, ...) --Damage is possible**

  

  

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Pour agar plates for heat shock test: Test transformation by heat shock with NEB control vector PUC19
-   Pour agar plates for first transformations: Agar plates with chloramphenicol
-   freeze E.coli from overnight culture
-   Heat shock test
