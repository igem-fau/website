## Protocol  

**Notes**

Digestion of pSEC with EcoR5 and NHE1  



|Name|Amount [µl]|
|--- |--- |
|DNA|1 µl (=2 µg)|
|Cut-Smart (10x)|5|
|EcoR5|0,5|
|NHE1|0,5|
|H2O|43|
-   60 minutes @ 37°C
-   20 minutes inactivation @ 80°C

Digestion of pUC19 with SmaI + Antarctic Phosphatase



|Name|Amount [µl]|
|--- |--- |
|DNA|10,6 µl (of Midiprep)|
|Cut-Smart (10x)|5|
|Antarctic Buffer x10|5|
|Antarctic Phosphatase|1|
|EcoR5|0,5|
|H2O|27,9|

-   60 minutes @ 37°C
-   20 minutes inactivation @ 80°C

  

Preparation of a 0,8% agarose gel

-   scheme see below
-   25 µl of the samples + 5 µl of 6x loading dye
-   5µl ladder
-   1h @130V

  

-   Extraction of line 5, 6 (digested pSEC vector with EcoRV and NheI)
-   QiaGen Gelextraction kit was used
-   sample stored at -20°C

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

- new digestion of pUC19 better would be to ask wether they have pUC19 stored somewhere as ours is out of bounds

- Gibson Assembly of CHO constructs in pSEC and potentially pUC19

- Heat Shock
