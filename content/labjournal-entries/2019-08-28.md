## Protocol  

**Notes**

-   Mini-prep of overnight cultures (K1, K2a, K2b) of each 5 clones
    -   eluation with 50µl MiliQ water
-   Ran a 0,8% Gel
-   Measured Plasmid DNA at Nanodrop

Performed a PCR with all of the Minis to confirm bands that are potentially depicting vector + insert

Primer for this PCR are stored at -20°C the original primer tubes have a concentration of 100µM. Besides them there are also Eppis with the ready to pcr concentration of 10µM;

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

Not a real problem but teh bands of corerct lenght were quite weak in comparison to what is probably just oure vector at 5,7kb;  
To tackle this issue PCR was performed. If the PCR is successfull, then Samples with vector + Insert will show a band of the corresponding inserts length in a gel;

**Materials used**

Q5 Hifi Polymerase **empty!**

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

  

-   Perform Gel with PCR Products;
-   Send positive ones to Kiel (call Matthias Peipp beforehand)
-   Furhter try to make the Measurement Part work --Puc digest or also possible to open any other vector blunt and clone the part behind a promotor
-   If successfull heatshock 
- Plate out
