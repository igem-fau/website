**Notes**



Take Plates with negative control for measurement Part out of the incubator, colonies grew on alle of them!

Picked clones and prepared ON cultures with 8 ml LB-Amp, put them in the fridge until later;



Medium Change 1h  prior to Transfection of the HEKs, DMEM without Hepes (cells were already in Medium without Hepes);

Confluence ~ 70%;



Prepare new LB Agar for new Chloramphenicol Plates;
35 g LB Agar were weighed in and mixed thorougly with 1 l Water;

Autoclaved Medium;



Performed Calciumchlorid Transfection:

Perpared two  mixes:

 A) 1 ml of 2x HBS in a 15 ml Falcon;



B)  DNA Mix: 

| Water              | 860 µl          |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Plasmid            | 20 µl (1 µg/µl) |
| 2,5 M CaCl2        | 100 µl          |
| 2,5 mM Chloroquine | 20 µl           |



Carefully apply the DNA mix to the 2x HBS over the time of 1 min, while constantly blowing air into the HBS with a Pipette boy;

Vortex the resulting Mix thorougly and apply it dropwise to the Cells;



After the prepared Medium has cooled sufficiently added Chloamphenicol (35 mg/ml) to reach a concentration of 25 µg/ml --735 µl;

Poured new Chloramph Plates;
Seeded the Heatshock Samples from 25.9 that were stored in the fridge onto Chloramphenicol Plates;

Placed them in the Incubator;



Placed the earlier prepared ON cultures in the shaker;



Performed Medium Change 6 h post transfection with 10 ml Medium;
