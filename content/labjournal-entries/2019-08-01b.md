* used PCR primers for amplification to screen for our inserted sequence
* forward primer the same for all the samples, used the respective reverse primers of each sample. For the ligated samples, the "b" primers were used.  

Template DNA		|5 µL		
------------------------|---------------|
Primer fw (10 µM)	|1.25 µL
Primer rev (10 µM)	|1.25 µL
Master Mix		|12.5 µL
autoclaved H2O		|5 µL	
		|25 µL

* checked success with a 1% agarose gel, run at 150 V for 1 h
* PCR was negative
  * too little amplification primers
  * wrong primers used
  * or no insert in our vector
