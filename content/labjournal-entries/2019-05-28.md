aimtask: Generation of pACYC184 plasmid
protocol: DNA extraction from agarose gel
date: 2019-05-28
participants: Eva Neugebauer
---
* run the gel from 2019-05-27 for 45 min at 130 V
* cut out the vector DNA from  the gel 
* place the gel pieces into reaction tubes

*DNA extraction from agarose gel:*

1. add 200 µL NTI per 100 mg gel piece
2. incubate for 5 min at 50°C
3. place the column in a collection tube and transfer the sample
4. centrifugate at 11000 rpm for 30 s
5. add 700 µL NT3 twice adn centrifugate each time at 11000 rpm for 30 s
6. dry the silica membrane for 1 min at 11000 rpm
7. place the column on a sterile 1.5 mL reaction tube
8. add 20 µL NE buffer and centrifugate for 1 min at 11000 rpm

*Ligation:*
DNA 			|9 µL
Quick Ligation buffer	|10 µL
Quick Ligase		|1 µL

Incubate for 10 min at room temperature

*Transformation into competent DH10B e.coli via heat shock:*

1. thaw competent bacteria on ice
2. add 10 µL of the previously ligated DNA, storage of the rest at -20°C
3. incubate 30 min on ice
4. incubate 1 min at 42°C
5. incubate 2 min on ice
6. add 500 µL Soc medium
7. 30 min on 37°C

plate the bacteria on Cam plates, incubate at 37°C over night

*Control gel for the ligation:*

* loading of 2 µL of each sample with 2 µL running buffer
* run the gel for 1 h at 130 V
* for each sample only one band visible
