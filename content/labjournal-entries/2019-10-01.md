## Protocol  

**Notes**

  

Harvesting K2a and K2b supernatant, reapply 4 ml of Medium to the plates;

  

Prepared new plates for transfection;

Took 3 flasks with HEk Cells and collected the cells in a 50 ml Falcon after making them loose with trypsin and inactivating it again with Medum;

Cells were counted using a Neubauer Chamber in a 1:1 Dilution with Trypan Blue;  
Counted: 115/131/119 --Mean is 121,6 Cells per quadrant --Therefore 2,432*106  cells/ml;

Seed 4*106 cells per Plate for the transfection tomorrow (1,64 ml of the cell suspension);

The remaining 5,4 ml (~13*106  cells) were applied to a new cell culture flask;  
Everything was put in the incubator @37 °C, 5% Co2;
