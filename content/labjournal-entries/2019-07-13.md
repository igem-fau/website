* thawed stock bacteria on ice
* inocculated 2 25 µL of each strain (Tuner and DH5alpha) in 100 mL LB medium and incubated for 1:45 h until OD600 was 0.4-0.6
* not much 10 % glycerol available so the two cultures of each strain have been pooled and washed together
* frozen in 50 µL aliquots

* modification of used protocol: 8.7 % glycerol used instead of 10 %
