## Protocol  
**Notes**

-   PCR of the iGEM measurment part CFP
    -   50µl reaction


||1x|2,5x|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Q5 high fidelity master mix|25µl|62,5µl|
|10µM forward primer|1,25 µl|3,125µl|
|10µM reverse primer|1,25µl|3,125µl|
|template DNA (CFP)|0,5µl (=25ng)|-|
|nuclease free water|22µl|55µl|

-   with melting temperature of 56°C
-   program from the protocol
-   PCR products are stored at -20°C
    -   M = measurement part
    -   C = control with water
-   gel electrophoresis
    -   1% gel
    -   run for 1h, 120V

**Scheme:**

ladder (7µl) - measurment part (25µl -->10 µl PCR product + 10µl MilliQ + 5µl loading Dye) - water control ("")

-->see below

-   gel extraction via qiagen gel extraction kit
    -   band of CFP at 723 bp (see picture below)
    -   elution with 50µl MiliQ water
    -   storage at -20°C
    
**Protocol**

Q5 high fidelity PCR Kit, qiagen gel extraction kit

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

Measurement of DNA concentration of extracted PCR product (CFP --stored at -20°C)
