**Notes**



**Colony PCR**



Preparation of labled Eppis with 1 mL LB with Chloramphenicol. 



Preparation of Mastermixes for the colony PCR with: Q5 MM, Primers, Water as followed (3 colonies of each construct):

|           | K1 (3 reactions) | All other constructs (21 reactions) |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Q5 MM     | 37,5 µL          | 262,5 µL                            |
| fw primer | 3,75 µL          | 26,25 µL                            |
| re primer | 3,75 µL          | 26,25 µL                            |
| H2O       | 30 µL            | 210 µL                              |

Primers:

- ​    K1: "K1 restriction fw" and "K1 restriction re"
- ​    all other constructs: "restriction fw" and "restriction re"



25 µL per colony master mix in the according PCR tube. 



Picking of clones with a pipet tip



PCR program: Konstrukt amplification

​    modifcation: 1st step at 90°C 10 min



Gel electrophores (1% agarose, 130 V)

2 µL Loading dye was added to the 10 µL PCR and then loaded on the gel. 





Loading scheme of the gel (2 x 14 pockets, 1mm wide): 



First Row: 

1 kb Ladder | K1.1 | K1.2 | K1.3 |K2a1.1 | K2a1.2 | K2a1.3 | K2b.1| K2b.2 | K2b.3 | K3a.1 | K3a.2 |   K3a.3  



Second Row:

1 kb Ladder   K3b.1 | K3b.2 | K3b.3 | K4a.1 | K4a.2 | K4a.3 | K4b.1 | K4b.2 | K4b.3 | K2a2.1 | K2a2.2 | K2a.3  






**Calculations and Results**

Weak bands

​    might be repeated with with more cycles!



 

**Problems faced / possible error causes**



Didn't prepare 1 replicate in the MM, therefore the last tube had a little less volume than the others.

Switched poles during electrophoresis, therefore lost the first row. 



**Mini Prep**

Miniprep of ON cultures of the colonies that were incubated after colony PCR (09.09.19)

Assessment of success using gel electrophoresis (1% gel, 130 V)
