## Protocol 

_**Notes**_

-   Before the purification the according DNA bands were cut out of the gel
-   The gel pieces were transferred into Eppendorf Reaction Tubes, which were weighed beforehand;
-   The mass of the gel pieces was determined by repeated weighing, to determine the necessary amounts of reagents

  

  

  

**Protocol**

Protocol of the NucleoSpin Extract Kit

  
**Calculations and Results**

-   Reaction Tube weight (empty): K2b 1,013g K3b 1,014g K4a 1,013g K4b 1,013g
-   Weight of Gelfragments: K2b 0,287g K3b 0,356g K4a 0,288g K4b 0,287g

  

-   For each 100mg gel 300ul of NT1 buffer should be used
-   Amount of NT1 buffer:  K2b 861ul K3b 1068ul K4a 863ul K4b 861ul

  

  

  

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

The gel fragments were quite large; This might have a negative impact on the efficiency of the purification;

As the lab with the nanodrop was already closed the Concentration of the processed DNA could not be assesed at this day;

  

  

**Materials used**

-   NucleoSpin Extract Kit

  

  

**Files used / generated**

  

  

  

  

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Measure DNA concentrations
