## Protocol  
**  
Notes**

  

**Gibson Assembly  
**

According to 2.8.19: CHO constructs and measurement part were taken up in 20 µl TE buffer. --concentration: 50ng/µl

concentration pSec: 26,8 ng/µl

using 50 ng pSec --1,86 µl

using insert three-fold: 150 ng --3 µl ; used inserts: CHO K1, CHO K2a, CHO K2b, measurement part

also performed a positive control with the provided kit.



|Amount in µl|Name|
|--- |--- |
|1,86|Vector pSec|
|3|Insert|
|10|Gibson Assembly Master Mix|
|5,14|dH2O|

Incubated at 50 °C in thermocycler for 30mins.

  

**Heatshock**

performed a heatshock with the Gibson Assembly with DH5a bacteria, following Evas protocoll. Used 18 µl of the assembly samples.

Plated the bacteria on Amp plates and put in incubator to be continued with tomorrow.

  

**Gel electrophoresis**

prepared a 0.8% agarose gel with 0,8 g agarose in 100 ml TE buffer. microwaved and added SybrGreen after short cooling period.

Mixed 2 µl of DNA sample with 2 µl of DNA Purple Dye and 16 µl of water.

Added 7 µl DNA Ladder

Order: wayward DNA Ladder - empty - DNA Ladder - CHO K1 - CHO K2a - CHO K2b - Measurement Part - Positive control

  
**Calculations and Results**

  

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

  

Nothing just DNA ladder visible on gel. Might have used not enough DNA sample?

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   take plates out of incubator, pick colonies
-   find a new pUC19 vector to try
