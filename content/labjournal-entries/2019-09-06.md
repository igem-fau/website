Checked the ON cultures in the Shaker --> A 500 ml Aliquot was frozen away after centrifuging and getting rid of the supernatant;

The other 4,5 ml were spinned down in hte Megafuge for 5 min, 4000 rpm --> Alle the pellets were rather small so the Samples were put into the Shaker under the same conditions for a couple more hours;



The ordered Primer for Restriction Overhang PCR were diluted in TE-Buffer, so that the concentration is 100 µM;

 

| **Name**          | **DNA [nmol]** | **TE-Buffer [µl]** |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| K1 restriction fw | 31,9           | 319                |
| K1 restriction re | 32,4           | 324                |
| Restriction fw    | 99,9           | 999                |
| Restriction re    | 106,8          | 1068               |



Incubation @ 50 °C to elute the Primers;
