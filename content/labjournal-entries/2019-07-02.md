Name | Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 | Attempt 3  
-----------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------  
DNA | 1 µg (=0,5 µl) | 2 µg (= 1 µl) | 1 µg (= µl)  
NEB buffer 3.1 (x10 ) | 5 | 5 | -  
  
## Protocol  
  

**Notes**

-   dissolved primers for amplification in TE buffer to a concentration of 100mM
-   froze each primer diluted in TE with a concentration of 1mM (labeled according to construct)
-   dissolved all remaining DNA of the constructs in 20 µl TE buffer
-   prepared 2 1:100 pre-dilutions of the primer for the PCR, first in TE buffer, second in RNase-free water
-   performed PCR according to NEB protocol
-   stored PCR products in 4 °C fridge
-   prepared agarose gel for electrophresis (needs to be repeated)

  

  

**Protocol**

  

**Dissolving freeze-dried DNA**

-   spin down aliquots
-   add required volume of TE buffer (20 µl)
-   vortex thoroughly
-   incubate on the heating block at 50°C for 20 min

  

**PCR (according to the NEB protocol)**



|template DNA|5 µl (250 ng)|
|--- |--- |
|forward primer (10 µM)|1.25 µl (end concentration 0.5 µM)|
|reverse primer (10 µM)|1.25 µl (end concentration 0.5 µM)|
|Master Mix|12.5 µl|
|RNase-free water|5 µlpr|
||25 µl|

-   programme is saved under Thomas Winkler >Nina >iGEM
-   can otherwise be found in the NEB protocol
    -   30 cycles at 60°C

  

**Agarose gel**

-   0.8 g Agarose
-   100 ml TAE buffer
-   10 µl SYBR Safe
-   medium chamber

  

-   slot chamber onto its sled with the open ends aligning with the edge of the sled
-   cautiously pour the liquid agarose into the chamber, avoid air bubbles
-   insert the comb
-   **DO NOT MOVE AFTER AGAROSE HAS BEEN ADDED!** Otherwise liquid will slosh out and gel will be too thin
-   gels can be stored in a plastic dish with a little bit of TAE buffer at 4°C or wrapped in saran film

  
**Calculations and Results**
-   calculated volume for dissolving the primers:  **V=m/(M*c)**  with m and M found on the aliquots and c set as  **100 mM**

 **Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**
-   run electrophoresis with PCR products
