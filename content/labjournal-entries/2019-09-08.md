***Notes***



Checked the Plates in the Incubator;

The Cells with the E.  coli Restriction constructs were seeded on the wrong plates AMp+ Plates instead of CAM plates;

The Cells with the Measurement Part (CFP) have grown nicely; Most colonies grew with the Tuner strain;



2l New LB Medium with 20g LB powder per Liter were prepared and autoclaved;



New Heatshock with the Rest of the Ligation samples (15 µl) into Tuner;

200 µl of the Heatshock samples were plated on CAM+ Plates and Placed in the incubator @ 37 °C; (Rest stored @ 4 °C)



Made 3 ON cultures with LB Amp+ (300 ml) one for each of the Measurement Part Plates (BL21, Tuner, Star);

Put them in the Shaker @ 37 °C, 230 rpm


  ***Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab***



\- Prepare new competent cells (BL21, Star, Tuner, DH5a);

\- Check Plates in the Incubator and prepare cultures --Mini Prep;

\- Check Cultures in the Shaker and prepare for CFP Measuring;
