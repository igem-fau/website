## Protocol  
**Notes**

-   BACS stock of
    -   CHO K1, clone 2
    -   CHO K1, clone 1
    -   CHO K2a, clone 4
    -   DH5a positive control
        -   storage at -80°C (in box of electrocompetent tuner and DH5a)
-   Mini-prep of overnight culture
    -   eluation with 50µl MiliQ water

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Measerment of the DNA concentrations
-   gel of Mini-Prep (did Gibson work?)
-   Digestion of puC19 with ecoRV
-   Gibson Assembly
-   sent CHOs to Kiel
