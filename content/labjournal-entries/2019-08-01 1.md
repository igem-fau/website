## Protocol 
**Notes**

-   Restriction digest with Ase1 and Pcu1.
    -   12 µL H2O
    -   5 µL DNA
    -   2 µL CutSmart Buffer 3.1
    -   0,5 µL Ase1
    -   0,5 µL Pvu1
      
      -incubation 1h 37 °C
          
            

Gel Electrophoresis in 1% Agarose in TAE + SYBR green  
**Calculations and Results**

  

Ase1 part of the vector and also part of each construct

-Ase1 cuts sticky ends -occurence of multimers

-Smallest piece is 329 kb, additinal bands due to multimers

-These bands can be found for every construct

Pvu1 cuts only 2a in two site

-many fragments from construct 2a

**Result**: The Construct had been inserted into the vector successfully!


**Problems faced / possible error causes**

  

Pvu1 was mistakingly used in an attempt to cut the insert. However, cutting site is only in 2a. Ase1 sufficient for the intepretation of the results.

  

  

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

confirm results with PCR of the insert
