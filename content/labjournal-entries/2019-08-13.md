* Miniprep of the samples: 
  * K1-1 Tuner, K1-2 Tuner, K1-3 Tuner
  * K2a-1 Tuner, K2a-2 Tuner, K2a-3 Tuner
  * K2b-1 Tuner, K2b-2 Tuner, K2b-3 Tuner
  * K1 Star
  * negative control

* digestion of isolated DNA from Miniprep:

| Name | Volume 			
|----------------|---------------
| EcoRV		| 1 µL	|
| NheI		| 1 µL |
| CutSmart Buffer	| 5 µL |
| DNA		| 1 µL |
| dH2O		| ad 50 µL |


* incubation for 15 min at 37 °C

* PCR clean up of the samples:

  * K2a, K2b, K3a from 2nd amplification from 15.7 !! no clear description on tubes of 2nd amplification and no picture of gel ==possible error source !!
  * K3b, K4a, K4b from 1st amplification
  * end volume 50 µL
