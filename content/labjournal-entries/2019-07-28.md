## Protocol  
  

**Notes**

-   **No mini-prep columns left!! --Wait for new order.**
-   Transformed E.coli are stored at 4°C and are waiting for their mini-prep  **(4**.5 ml left)**
-   **Aliquoted 50% Glycerol in LB-medium in 15 ml Falcon**

  

**Storage of 500µl transformed E.coli at -80°C**

**Protocol:**

1.  Mix 500µl vortexed transformed E.coli with 500µl 100% Glycerol solution
2.  Different colonies are labeled 1 and 2. Some Construct transformed E.colis have 2 aliquots, because of 2 colonies picked
3.  Store at -80°C

  

**K1 Gel Extraction:**

-   Preparation for Blunt-End Cloning
-   Extract K1 amplificat (11.07.2019) out of a 0.8% agarose gel
-   Use 6µl of K1 and 15µl of H20 control --2µl of K1 are left for further PCRs
-   Run at 110V for 90 minutes
-   Plot: 4µl Ladder - empty - K1 - empty - H20

  

**Plated 200µl K3a+b on Agar-Chloramphenicol plates**

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

-   Amplification PCR are not perfectly labeled. Unsure if it was K1 or Water control --Used both in our gel electrophoresis
-   **NO K1 Amplificat left in tube! Gel Extraction was not possible**

  

**Materials used**

-   4µl DNA Ladder
-   Gel extraction Kit (1 prep)
-   10ml Glycerol

  

  

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Blunt-End cloning of purified K1 in pACYC184
-   Mini-prep of all our transformed E.coli
    -   PCR to validate Gibson Assembly and transformation success.
-   Pick colony of K3a+b and Incubate in Lb - Chloramphenicol medium for mini-prep
