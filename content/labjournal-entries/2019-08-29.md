## Protocol  

**Notes**

The PCR samples from 28.8 were applied to two 0,8% Agarose Gel and ran at 130V for 1 hour.

  

Gel 1:

Ladder K1 c1 K1 c2 K1 c3 K1c4 K1 c5 K2a c1 K2a c2 K2a c3 K2a c4 K2a c5

Gel 2:

Ladder K2b c1 K2b c2 K2b c3 K2b c4 K2b c5 Control

The PCR was performed to see whether the desired Insert was implemented into the vector, as the Gel from 28.8 allowed no precise determination.

The PCR Water-control showed a clear band at approximately 1,2 kb. This band was also seen in every other samples, hinting towards contamination of the water or PCR mix.

Other than that, the PCR samples did not show bands that would allow the assumption of successful Gibson assembly. Probably all the vectors are empty.

Another Digestion of pUC19 was performed to exclude potential problems with the blunt cutting enzymes due to re-ligation.

EcoRI and HindIII were used and were expected to yield a 2,6 kb and a 0,1 kb fragment.  
Of EcoRI and HindIII a 1:10 Dilution was performed for easier pipetting.

Digestion Mix:

|Name|Amount [µl]|
|--- |--- |
|DNA (pUC Midi 467,5 ng/µl)|4,27|
|CutSmart x10|5|
|EcoRI|1|
|HindIII|2|
|Water|37,73|
|Total Amount|50|

Digestion @ 37°C for 1h;

Inactivation @ 80°C for 20min;

Samples applied to a 0,8% Agarose Gel: Ladder pUC19

The digest gave the same result as every other digest with blunt end enzymes, indicating that the pUC19 sample we use is in fact contaminated, or no pUC19 at all!

To clarify which of the stored samples in the freezer @ -20°C and in the refrigerator @ 4°C are still of use Gel electrophoresis was performed.

**Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Decision which of the tested samples remains usefull and should therefore be kept in storage;
-   Find alternative to pUC19 for the measurement part
    -   One can  **not**  perform blunt end cloning with the ordered gBlocks
    -   However it should be possible with the PCr products of the gBlocks as the have 5' phosphate groups
