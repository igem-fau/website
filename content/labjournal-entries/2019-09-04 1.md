aimtask: CFP ligation with restrictionenzyme digest

date: 2019-09-04 
participants: Eva Neugebauer

**Notes**



**Plates of Heatshock (03.09.2019)**

4 small clonies detactable

Plate back to incubator

Later clone picking



**1% Agarose gel**



M (5µL) | 1 CFP 01. | 2 CFP 01. | puc19 Verdau 3.9. | - | - | M(5µL) |  PCR L | PCR R



For: 1 CFP 01., 2 CFP 01., puc19 Verdau 3.9. following composition was used: 

5µL DNA, 3,3 µL Loading Dye, 11,7 µL MilliQ water



For: PCR R and PCR L following composition was used:

12µL DNA, 3,3 µL Loading Dye, 4,7 µL MilliQ water



Gel running running at 110V 



No band for the vector -probably not enough DNA loaded on the gel



Cutting out the CFP from the PCR (PCR L was the probe and R the control)



**Problems faced / possible error causes**

Plate was the wrong way round in the incubator

No negative control for the heatshock -clones might be just undigested vector
