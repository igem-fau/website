* made 15 LB-Agar plates with Ampicilin
* heatshock of the constructs of CHO constructs K1, K2a, K2b in BL21, BL21 Star, Tuner and DH5alpha, plus a positive and negative control in BL21 Star (=14 different transformations)
  * used 2 µL of the Gibson assembly
  * used SOC medium for the bacteria after the heatshock
* plated bacteria afterwards on the LB-Agar plates 
* incubation at 37 °C
