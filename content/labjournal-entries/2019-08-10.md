aimtask: Heatshock of Gibson CHO-S (K1, K2a, K2b)
protocol: NEB Heatshock 
date: 2019-08-10
participants: Felix Pfister, Jannik Wagner

* made 15 LB-Agar plates with Ampicilin
* heatshock of the constructs of CHO constructs K1, K2a, K2b in BL21, BL21 Star, Tuner and DH5alpha, plus a positive and negative control in BL21 Star (=14 different transformations)
..* used 2 µL of the Gibson assembly
..* used SOC medium for the bacteria after the heatshock
* plated bacteria afterwards on the LB-Agar plates 
* incubation at 37 °C
