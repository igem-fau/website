## Protocol 
> **  
> Notes**

  

-   Did a MidiPrep of ON Cultures from 18.08
    -   Concentration:

|Name|K1-1|K1-2|K1-3|K2a-1|K2a-2|K2a-3|K2b-1|K2b-2|K2b-3|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Conc [ng/µl]|33,9|31,9|27,4|38,7|31,7|27,4|28,5|44,4|26,1|

    - Agarose-Gel electrophoresis for validation

|Component|Amount|
|--- |--- |
|DNA|3 µl|
|6X Loading Dye|2 µl|
|dH2O|1 µl|

    - -   -   --> Same Loading order as NanoDrop concentration measurment

  

  

-   Did an ON Culture of a single conlony of pUC19 (18.08)
    -   Picked one colony and incubated it in 5 ml LB+Amp in the shaker @37°C
    -   In the late afternoon --> 1:500 in 85ml LB+Amp --> shake for 12-16h @37°C

-   Control digestion of CHO Constructs
    -   Restriction enzymes: ApaI and HindIII-HF

|||
|--- |--- |
|Component|Amount|
|DNA|300 ng|
|ApaI|1 µl|
|HindIII-HF|1 µl|
|||
|--- |--- |
|CutSmart Buffer|5|
|||
|--- |--- |
|dH2O|ad 50 µl|

-   -   Protocol
        -   Incubate ApaI at 25°C for 5-15 minutes
        -   Add 1.0 µl (or 10 units) of HindIII-HF and  Incubate at 37°C for 5-15 minutes
        -   Inactivate both at 80°C for 20 minutes

> **Problems faced / possible error causes**

-   Low concentration of construc --> more LB+amp Medium next time with longer incubation time in the shaker?

  

> **Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

  

-   MidiPrep of ON Culture of pUC19
-   Empty constructs --> repeat gibson
