Turbidity in the ON culture visible

*Miniprep:*

1. Centrifugate the ON culture at 4000 rpm at room temperature
2. Discard the supernatant
3. Add 200 µL P1 buffer
4. Add 200 µL P2 buffer and mix by inverting two times
5. Add 400 µL P3 buffer and mix by inverting three times
6. Centrifugate the samples for 2 min in a microcentrifuge
7. Place the column in a collection tube and transfer the supernatant
8. Centrifugate for 30s
9. Discard the flow-through and return of the column to the collection tube
10. Add 200 µL Endo-Wash buffer and centrifugate for 30 s
11. Add 400 µL Plasmid Wash buffer and centrifugate for 1 min
12. Place the column in a 1.5 mL tube, add 30 µL DNA Elution Buffer and centrifugate for 30 s

Storage of the purified plasmid DNA at 4°C
