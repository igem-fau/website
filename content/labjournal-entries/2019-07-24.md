protocol: Gibson assembly instructions, heat shock protocol
date: 2019-07-24
participants: Jannik Wagner, Lena Schorr

* measured DNA concentrations of all constructs
* calculated the amount of DNA and vector for the Gibson assembly
* Gibson assembly of 2a, 2b, 3a+b, 4a+b
* transformation of the constructs into BL21 via heat shock
  * 200 µL bacteria with 2 µL Gibson reagent
* preparation of chloramphenicol plates
* plated transformed bacteria --> incubator at 37 °C

**Concentrations of DNA of the constructs:**

* K1: 808.9 ng/µL
* K2a: 868.7 ng/µL
* K2b: 847.2 ng/µL
* K3a: 791 ng/µL
* K3b: 819.1 ng/µL
* K4a: 776.1 ng/µL
* K4b: 805.9 ng/µL

**Lengths of the DNA constructs:**

* K1: 1629 bp
* K2a: 1278 bp
* K2b: 1218 bp
* K3a: 801 bp
* K3b: 753 bp
* K4a: 801 bp
* K4b: 759 bp

**Calculation of the amount of contruct and vector needed for the Assembly:**

* our constructs and vector in pmol/µl (with the formula: amount of DNA * 1000 / bp of the constructs + 650 Da)
* K1: 1.04 pmol/µL
* K2a: 1.097 pmol/µL
* K2b: 1.46 pmol/µL
* K3a: 1.36 pmol/µL
* K3b: 1.49 pmol/µL
* K4a: 1.34 pmol/µL
* K4b: 1.46 pmol/µL

--> 1:3 dilution with H2O --> 1 µL was taken for the Gibson Assembly (=0.37 pmol/µl for construct 2a)
-->Vector (pACYC): same amount: ~0.4 pmol/µL 

**Gibson Protocol:**

* 0.02-0.5 pmol/µL DNA
* 10 µL Gibson assembly master mix
* 10 µL dH2O
