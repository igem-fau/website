## Protocol 
_**  
Notes**_

**Check the Plates from 17.8.19 CHO-S Constructs K1, K2a, K2b:**

On all of the plates the seeding worked fine and clones can be picked later on for ON cultures;
**New Attempt to digest pUC19:**

|Name|Attempt 1 [µl]|Attempt 2 [µl]|
|--- |--- |--- |
|DNA|17,5 (pUC19 c1)|18,6 (pUC19 c3)|
|CutSmart x10|5|5|
|AntarcticBuffer x10|5|5|
|Antarctic Phosphatase|1|1|
|SmaI|0,5|1|
|H2O|21|19,4|
  
  The first attempt was @25 °C for 1 hour;

Inactivation @ 80 °C for 20 min;

  

Second attempt incubation @37 °C for 1 hour;

Inactivation @ 80 °C for 20 min;

  

Both of the samples were to find better conditions as the digest from 17.8.19 were not optimal;

25 °C is the optimal temperature for SmaI, whereas 37 °C is the optimum for the phosphatase;

With 1 hour incubation time also the 25 °C should be suitable for the phosphatase and likewise the 37 °C are acceptable for SmaI, given that the efficacy of the digest is lowered by approx 50% (information on the NEB site);

None of the Digests showed optimal results;

  

Both were looked at in an 0,8% agarose gel, each for their own.

The order looked like the following:


| 1kb DNA Ladder (5µl)| empty | Half Sample (30µl):5 µl Staining |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 25 µl Sample|empty|Half Sample (30 µl):5 µl Staining25 µl Sample|


Attempt 1 of todays pUC19 digest did show a similar result to yesterdays digestion

Expected was one band of 2,7 kb length (see picture from virtual digest 17.8.19);

The suspected bands were cut out and extracted from the gel (QiaQuick Gel Extraction Kit);

  

Sample 1: 0,36 g; Sample2: 0,3 g;

--1060 µl QG; --900 µl QG

  

Protocoll of the Kit was used, the DNA was solved in 50 µl H2O;

The resulting DNA was measured in the Nanodrop;
  

|Sample Name|260|280|260/280|ng/µl|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Attempt 1 first half|0,026|0,030|0,87|1,29|
|Attempt 1 second half|0,033|0,041|0,81|1,66|

With these low DNA concentrations Gibson Assembly is not feasible without increasing the reaction volume substantially;  
Therefor one should ask one of the TAs for advise to increase the DNA concentrationin a reliable way;

  

**ON culture of Single Colonies from CHO-S K1, K2a, K2b**

For each of the three constructs three colonies were picked and carefully seeded in 5 ml LB-Medium (Amp+) under sterile conditions;

Placed in the incubator @ 37 °C 130 rpm (time approx. 18:30);

  

**Heatshock pSec:**

Stored pSec has a concentration of 2 µg/µl --a 1:10 dilution was performed to pipette 100 ng of vector DNA for the heatshock procedure;

The 100 ng of pSec vector DNA were used for 200 µl DH5a;

Evas' protocoll was used;

A plate of LB-Agar (Amp+) was seeded and put in the incubator @ 37 °C (time approx. 18:30);

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

Gel bands did indicate a non optimal digest --Not suspected bands and maybe also religation??;

The other digestion Attempt worked as bad as the first or the one from 17.8.19;

Not sure which of the bands is the actual cut vector as one bamd is visible at approx. 3kb, one band looks more like 2 kb and maybe there is a very thin band at 2,7 kb which would be the expected position;

Ask TA with the gel photo for advise and maybe also advise for a proper digestion --Might be that it was not to few but rather to much enzyme??

Also DNA purification from the Gel yielded only an extremly low amount of DNA --Gibson not performable;

  

  

**P**ending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

Take the overnight cultures of Gibson CHO K1, K2a, K2b out of the incubator

Take the plate from pSec out of the incubator

Mini-Prep of pSec & freeze

Speak to the TA or PhD: Discuss the gel bands of the digests & how to increase the concentration of pUC19 digest 2 to continue with gibson assembly
