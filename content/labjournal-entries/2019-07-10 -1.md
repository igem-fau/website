* aliquoted 15% DMSO
* used original amplified DNA of K1, K2a, K3a
* added DMSO to a final concentration of 3%
* lowered running temperature of the PCR from 57 °C to 55 °C due to DMSO
* prepared 1:100 dilution of the respective primers (--1mM) in TE buffer and stored them at -20 °C
* prepared a further 1:100 dilution (--10 µM) in dH2O for the PCR
