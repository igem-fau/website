**Notes**

- Digestion of paCYC and K1, K2a, K2b, K3a, K3b, K4a, K4b with ClaI and SmaI --wrong enzymes!!! (instead of SmaI, SalI should have been unsed)
- Heat-Shock of constructs (K1-1, K1-2, K2a-1, K2a-2, K2b-1, K2b-2) in DH5a
  - with 0,5µl of Mini samples from 30.8.19
  - plating the constructs on Amp plates
  - storage in the incubator
- Overhang PCR with K1, K2a, K2b, K3a, K3b, K4a, K4b (from initial IDT constructs) and K2a, K2b, K3a, K4b from PCR clean up from 13.08.

- gel electrophoresis (0,8% and 1%)
  - 0,8%: ladder - K1 - K2a - K2b - K3a - K3b - K4a - K4b - H2O (from the initiall constructs)
  - 1%: ladder - K2a - K2b - K3a - K3b - K4a - K4b - H20



- Preparation of overnight culture of heat shocked bacteria with LB and Amp
