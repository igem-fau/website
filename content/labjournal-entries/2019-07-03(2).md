NEB buffer 3.1 (x10 ) | 5 | 5 | -  
  
## Protocol  
  

**Notes**

**Prepare Primer Solution:**

-   centrifuge primers
-   add TE-buffer to dilute primers to a concentration of 100nM
-   Vortex
-   heat and shake at 50°C in thermomixer
-   **freeze and store at -20°C**

  

**Protocol**

-   **Ran gelelectrophoresis with PCR products 02.07.2019 with 100x**

|DNA|2µl|
|--- |--- |
|Loading Dye(6x)|2µl|
|H20|16µl|

-   Put 20µl in each pocket
-   put 6µl DNA Ladder in one pocket

  

**Gibson - PCR:**

|template DNA|5 µl (250 ng)|
|--- |--- |
|forward primer (10 µM)|1.25 µl (end concentration 0.5 µM)|
|reverse primer (10 µM)|1.25 µl (end concentration 0.5 µM)|
|Master Mix|12.5 µl|
|Autoclaved H20|5 µlpr|
||25 µl|

-   NEW PCR PROGRAM: igem gibson anhang
-   PCR is running over night. Finishes around 9pm and is then stored at 4°C in the PCR cycler

  
**Calculations and Results**

  

  

**Problems faced / possible error causes**

-   No Protocol! People should make clear which protocol they want to use
-   Tested PCR Products on quantity with biophotometer: No clear results. Results are in our lab notebook

  

  

**Materials used**

-   16 PCR Tubes and caps

> **Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**

-   Run Gel electrophoresis. See day before
-   Gibson Assembly of Fab Fragments
-   Gibson Assembly of different constructs into vector
-   Loading Dye 6x is stored in the fridge in Winkler's Lab
