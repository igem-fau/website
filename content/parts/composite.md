title: Composite Parts
color: purple

We, as the iGEM team FAU_Erlangen aim to create bispecific antibodies. Therefore we created six composite parts for the expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The parts include the sequence for a complete bispecific antibody and two constructs with either SpyTag or SpyCatcher sequence attached to build a comparable bispecific antibody, but with the possibility to create a modular system for bispecific antibodies supported by our simulations prior to construct design.
