The Team FAU_Erlangen 2019 added 26 parts to the Parts Registry of iGEM. All of the parts were part of the project, dealing with the creation of different varieties of antibody constructs. The main focus was the creation of bispecific antibodies fused by flexible linkers and by the so called SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. A special property of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system is the linkage of distinct molecules by an isopeptide bond establishing a basis for a modular system. The part collection provides a toolbox with modular components to create different kinds of antibodies.
