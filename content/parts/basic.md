For the basic parts, components for the creation of bispecific antibodies for expression in E.coli and
HEK 293T cells were provided.

## Linker sequences

All the flexible linker are composed of small, non-polar (Glycine) and polar (Serine) amino
acids. The Gly4Ser linker is one of the most widely used flexible linker that can sustain the
bioactivity of fusion proteins. The distinct linker differ in the copy number of GGGGS, resulting
in different bioactivities of the fusion proteins.

## Conjugation system

For conjugation, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system was used in bacterial and eukaryotic
expression, forming an isopeptide bond.
